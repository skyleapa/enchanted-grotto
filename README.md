## Enchanted Grotto

### Build & Run Instructions
Both systems take in a `game|test` argument:
- `game` builds and runs the full game
- `test` builds and runs tests for item serialization and potion comparison mechanics
- If no arguments are supplied, the scripts default to `game`

#### Linux/macOS:
```bash
chmod +x run_game.sh
./run_game.sh [game|test]
```

#### Windows (test currently broken):

```bash
.\run [game|test]
```
